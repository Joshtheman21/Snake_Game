# Snake_Game
Here I remade one of the most fun and early 2000's game known to man. DUN DUN DUN The Snake Game. Try to get your score higher and higher, while not crashing into the wall and yourself. This program was done using Object-Oriented Programming and Python. Also using the turtle graphic class, Enjoy!
